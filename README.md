## 2 Overview

The SGF tool is a synthetic data generator. Starting from a sensitive input dataset, it produces a synthetic dataset in a privacy-preserving way. Two kinds of privacy guarantees are supported: `(k,γ)`-plausible deniability, and `(ε,δ)`-differential privacy. We refer the reader to the VLDB publication for definitions and discussions of those guarantees.

The tool consists of three executable programs: `sgfinit`, `sgfgen`, and `sgfextract`.

- `sgfinit` used to convert the input data into a format suitable for data synthesis.
- `sgfgen` used to perform the actual synthesis of the data, it will produce a set of candidate synthetic records.
- `sgfextract` takes a set of candidate synthetic records produced bysgfgenand extracts a subset of synthetic records.

## 3 Setup & Compilation

The tool itself is written in C++11. The cross-platform build system `cmake`^1 is required to compile the source code.

**Dependencies**. There are no external dependencies other that header-only libraries in-cluded in the archive.

**Portability**. The code has been written so that it is portable. Note: the tool has only
thoroughly tested on Linux with x8664 CPU.

(^1) https://cmake.org/

To setup and compile the tool on a UNIX system, you may use the following commands
which assume that the archive file `sgf-0.10a.tgz` is located in the current directory.

```bash
$ tar xf sgf -0.10a.tgz                     # extract files
$ cd sgf
$ mkdir bin && cd bin                       # out of source build
$ cmake ../ source && make && cd ..         # compile with cmake
```
The three compiled binary files `sgfinit`, `sgfgen`, and `sgfextract` will be located inside the bin sub-directory. The build type can be specified by using the flag `-DCMAKEBUILDTYPE=DEBUG` for a debug build or the flag `-DCMAKEBUILDTYPE=RELEASE` for a release build.

## 4 Example

The archive includes a pre-processed set of data files derived from the American Community
Survey 2013 (ACS13) data.^2
In this section, we use this data as an example to illustrate how the tool may be used.
We defer to Sections 5 and 6 for details about the available configuration options and the
input data format supported.

### 4.1 Pre-processing

The input dataset must be pre-processed into a set of input files that can be fed into the
tool. The format of the input files is specified in details in Section 6. In what follows we
provide a brief overview. The tool requires the following input files.

```
records: a csv file containing records to use for synthesis.
```
```
stats: a csv file containing records to use to train the generative model.
```
```
attrs: a file describing the attributes of the dataset and the possible values that each
attribute can take.
```
```
grps: a file describing a binning strategy for attributes (used to reduce the complexity
of the generative model).
```
```
dag: a file describing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) which captures statistical depen-
dencies between attributes; vertices represent attributes; edges represent dependencies.
```
```
order: a file providing a valid topological order^3 for the graph described in thedagfile.
```
The location of the input files is specified through the mandatorydataprefixconfigu-
ration option. This input file path prefix is the same for all six input files. For example,
if the prefix is set todata/acs13, the tool will expect to find therecordsfile using file-path
data/acs13records.csvand thedagfile using file-pathdata/acs13dag.csv.

(^2) https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/
(^3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting


The data records from the input dataset are to be partitioned into two disjoint sets, one
forrecordsand the otherstats. The format of those files is illustrated by the provided ACS
sample example:

```
age ,wc,edu ,ms ,occ ,rel ,race ,sex ,hpw ,waob ,incc
15,1,19,1,5,1,3,1,48,1,
31,1,21,3,18,1,5,2,40,1,
13,1,17,1,19,2,5,1,45,1,
16,3,17,1,19,1,5,1,40,1,
50,4,23,1,14,1,5,1,40,1,
...
```
Specifically,recordsandstatsinclude a header line and then one record per line.
The other four files, i.e.,attrs,grps,dag,orderare metadata files that describe various
aspect of the input dataset and control the generative model. They must be consistent with
recordsandstats. Section 6 provides details.

### 4.2 Setup

The tool will produce all outputs in a specified working directory calledworkdir. The
working directory path must be specified in the configuration file. It is recommended to create
a new working directory for every experiment (i.e., any new dataset or set of parameters).

```
$ mkdir workdir # create working directory
```
Initially, the working directory should contain the configuration file, a log configuration
file, and the input data files (or a link to them). This can be accomplished as follows.

```
$ cd workdir
$ ln -s ../bin. # link to binaries
$ cp ../ log.conf. # default log conf
$ cp ../ examples/acs13/sb.cfg ./my.cfg # config template
$ ln -s ../ examples/acs13/data. # link to dataset
$ echo "workdir="`pwd` >> ./my.cfg
$ echo "dataprefix="`pwd`/data/acs13 >> ./my.cfg
```
In this example, the configuration file is namedmy.cfg. Theexamples/sub-directory of the
archive contains sample configurations files which can used as templates.
There are four mandatory parameters to specify in the config file. The first two are
workdiranddataprefix. (It is recommended to use absolute paths.) The third is the
number of attributes in the input dataset. The provided acs13 samples contain 11 attributes,
so the config file should containattrs=11. The fourth and last parameter is the mechanism
to use. This parameter admits two values: seedbasedormarginals. These correspond to
the two models described in the VLDB publication. Note thatmarginalsis meant to be
used as a baseline and will almost always produce lower quality output thanseedbased.
Every timesgfinit,sgfgen, orsgfextractis run the tool will produce a log file (named
based on the PID) in thelogs/sub-directory of the working directory. This log file can be


used to monitor the progress and will typically contain additional information not written
out to the console/stdout.

### 4.3 Initialization

To initialize the synthesis process,sgfinitis used. The program takes only one command-
line argument: the path to the configuration file. Assuming the current directory is the
working directory,sgfinitis invoked as follows.

```
$ ./bin/sgfinit ./my.cfg
```
Upon successful termination, filesrecords.datandstats.datwill be created at the root of
the working directory.

```
Important: The tool assumes that both the configuration file and the input data
files will not subsequently be modified.
```
### 4.4 Generation

To synthesize data, sgfgen should be run. This should always be done after running
sgfinit. The config file will customize the generation process through several parameters.
In particular, we can set the number of synthetics to generate (count) and the maximum
runtime (runtime) in seconds.

```
$ echo "count =1000" >> ./my.cfg
$ echo "runtime =3600" >> ./my.cfg
```
With these parameters,sgfgenwill run until it produces 1000 candidate synthetics, or for
at most one hour (whichever occurs first).
Once all configuration parameters have been set,sgfgenshould be invoked as:
$ ./bin/sgfgen ./my.cfg

The candidate synthetics produced are written to a file in thegen/ sub-directory of
the working directory. The synthesized records at this stage are only candidate synthetics
because depending on the target privacy guarantee not all of them can be safely released.
The generation process is embarrassingly parallel and so multiple instance ofsgfgencan
be run in parallel. For example,

```
$ for i in `seq 1 8`; do ./bin/sgfgen ./my.cfg & done
```
will run eight parallel instances of the program. Each instance will produce its own set of
synthetic candidates in a filegen/<PID>.out.

### 4.5 Extraction

Once a bunch of synthetic candidates have been produced, a synthetic dataset can be ex-
tracted usingsgfextract. Only a suitable set of synthetics is extracted so that the target
privacy guarantee is achieved.


The tool preserves privacy for both the records in therecords and those in thestats
file, but the purpose ofsgfextractis focused on the guarantee with respect to the records
inrecords. The privacy guarantee with respect tostatsdepends only on the following four
configuration options:ndist,ncomp,lambda,budget(Section 5) which only impactsgfgen.
Note that with themarginalsmechanism and for certain combinations of parameters
with theseedbasedmechanism, the generative model is independent of the seed, i.e.,seed-
less. When this is the case,sgfextractwill inform the user and the privacy guarantee
obtained doesnotdepend onrecordsor the size of the extracted dataset.
In all other cases, sgfextract will inform the user of the exact privacy guarantee
achieved. The basic privacy guarantee provided by sgfextractis (k,γ)-plausible denia-
bility.^4 The value ofγis specified by thegammaconfiguration option because it is required
bysgfgen. However, the value ofkis specified tosgfextract. Specifically, to extract a
synthetic data with plausible deniability fork= 50,sgfextractis invoked as followed.

```
$ cat ./gen /*.out > ./cand.out # get all candidates
$ ./bin/sgfextract ./my.cfg ./cand.out ./ext 50
```
The first command-line argument is the path to the configuration file. The second is the file
containing the synthetic candidates produced bysgfgen. The third is a file-path prefix for
the extracted dataset. The last argument is the value ofkwhich must be a positive integer.
The extracted synthetic dataset is a file calledext.synthwhich contains those synthetic
candidates which pass the privacy test (and thus meet the privacy guarantee) specifically
those for which at least 50 plausible seeds could be found. The format of this file is the same
as that of therecordsandstatsfiles.
If the user seeks to obtain a synthetic dataset with differential privacy guarantees (a
stronger guarantee than plausible deniability) thensgfextractcan be run in two additional
ways.
The first way is to specify (in addition tok): (1)nthe number of desired extracted syn-
thetic records, (2) the value of the privacy parameterε 0 , and (3) an integertinc. In this case,
sgfextract should be invoked as: sgfextract <config> <candidates> <outprefix>
<n> <k> <eps0> <tinc>. This extracts up ton synthetic records and provides a trade-
off curve based on a parametert, for each value oft(between 1 andk−1, by steps of size
tinc). The guarantee is of the form (εt,δt)-differential privacy. For example:

```
$ ./bin/sgfextract ./my.cfg ./cand.out ./ext 100 5000 0.01 250
```
extracts up to 100 synthetics withk= 5000 andε 0 = 0.01 and displays a trade-off curve for
values oftwith step size 250.
The second way is to specify (in addition tonthe number of desired extracted syn-
thetic records) the overall target privacy guarantee through (1) a security parameterλsuch
thatδ≤ 2 −λ, and (2) a privacy budgetεmax. In this case,sgfextractshould be invoked as:
sgfextract <config> <candidates> <outprefix> <n> <lambda> <epsmax>. In this case,
the tool optimizes the privacy parametersk,ε 0 , andtto meet the target guarantee. For
example:

```
$ ./bin/sgfextract ./my.cfg ./cand.out ./ext 100 40 1.
```
(^4) See the VLDB publication for a precise definition and some discussion.


extracts up to 100 synthetics such thatε≤1 andδ≤ 2 −^40.
Depending on the parameters, it may happen that few or even no synthetic records are
extracted. This is an indication that the parameters are either set inconsistently or their
values are so stringent that no synthetic candidate can be extracted while meeting the desired
privacy guarantee.

## 5 Configuration

The configuration file is a text file containing a single section[all]and a set of configuration
options. Each configuration option is given as a key-value pair on its own line. There is no
constraint on the order in which the configuration options appear in the file. Table 1 lists
all the available configuration options.

The following is an example of `seedbased` configuration:

<hl/>
```
[all]
workdir=<workdir_path >
dataprefix=<data_path_prefix >
mechanism=seedbased
attrs =
runtime =
count =
gamma=
omega =
ndist=geom
ncomp=seq
max_ps =
max_check_ps =
```
<hl/>

where<workdir_path>is to be replaced with an absolute path to the working directory and
<data_path_prefix>is to be replaced with an absolute path prefix to the input data files.
Several parameters such asomega,gamma,maxps, andmaxcheckpshavenoeffect for
marginals synthesis. The following is an example ofmarginalsconfiguration.

```
[all]
workdir=<workdir_path >
dataprefix=<data_path_prefix >
mechanism=marginals
attrs =
runtime =
count =
```

## 6 File Formats

The tool requires six input files: records, stats, attrs, grps, dag, and order. This section
describes their formats.
The current version only supports discrete attributes, thus continuous attributes must
be discretized a priori by the user. The tool expects each attribute to take values in the set
{ 1 , 2 ,...,n}for some positive integern. Remark: there can be at most 32,767 attributes
per dataset and for each attributen≤ 32 ,767.

```
Remark: Attributes and their values are always given with respect to the internal
representation of the tool andnot with respect to their meaning or representation
in the original dataset. For example, thesexis represented as the set{ 1 , 2 }. The
tool does not care that (with respect to the original dataset) ’1’ represents a female
and ’2’ represents a male.
```
### 6.1 Records and Stats

The files records andstats provide data for synthesis and the training of the generative
model, respectively. These two files should be in CSV format with a header line describ-
ing the attributes, and one record per line. For example, the first eight lines of exam-
ple/acs13/data/acs13stats.csvare the following.

```
age ,wc,edu ,ms ,occ ,rel ,race ,sex ,hpw ,waob ,incc
17,8,18,1,2,2,5,2,20,1,
29,4,19,1,7,1,5,2,30,1,
35,1,21,5,6,1,5,2,40,1,
38,1,16,4,2,1,4,1,40,3,
5,1,13,5,2,14,5,1,40,1,
3,1,19,5,13,16,5,2,35,1,
17,1,22,1,3,1,5,1,20,4,
```
Typically, the original dataset can simply be split into two disjoint subsets, one for
recordsand the other forstats. The attributes and attribute values ofrecordsandstatsmust
be consistent with the other four input files.

### 6.2 Attrs and Grps

Theattrsfile details one attribute per line (in order) with the following format:
<attributename>,<firstvalue>,<secondvalue>,...<lastvalue>.
In the current version, if an attribute can takendifferent values, then these values are:
1 , 2 ,...,n. For example, the content ofexample/acs13/data/acs13attrs.csvis the following.

```
age ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,$
wc ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
edu ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,$
ms ,1,2,3,4,
occ ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,$
```

```
rel ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,
race ,1,2,3,4,
sex ,1,
hpw ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,$
waob ,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
incc ,1,
```
In the aforementioned snippet, attributes valuesage,edu,occ,hpw, andhpware truncated
to fit within the width of this page. All four attributes admit values larger 21. For instance,
age ranges from 1 to 79.
Thegrpsfile details a binning strategy one attribute per line (in order) with the follow-
ing format:<binforvalue1>,<binforvalue2>,...,<binforvaluen>. The bins are
specified using their index in the set{ 1 , 2 ,...,k}wherek≥1 is the total number of bins
for that attribute. Theithline corresponds to theithattribute in the same order as theattrs
file. For example, the content ofexample/acs13/data/acs13grps.csvis the following.

```
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,$
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,
1,2,3,4,
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,2$
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,
1,2,3,4,
1,
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,$
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
1,
```
Lines for attributesage(line 1),occ(line 5), andhpw(line 9) are truncated to fit within
the width of this page. This example uses different numbers of bins and sizing for each
attribute. For instance, the values for attributems(marital status, line 4) are not binned,
i.e., each value is in its own bin. Observe that forj = 1, 2 ,...,5 valuej is in binj. In
contrast, for attributeage, values 1 through 10 (line 1) are all in the same bin (bin number
1) whereas values 11 to 20 are in bin 2.
We refer the reader to the VLDB publications for details on the binning strategy and
how it used by the generative model. Note that the binning has no impact on the output
synthetic dataset format.

### 6.3 DAG and Order

The generative model requires some knowledge of the statistical dependencies between the
dataset attributes. This information is specified through thedagfile as a description of a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The format of the file is the following. There is one attribute per line such that theithline
corresponds to theithattribute. Specifically, lineicontains a list of the attribute index of
eachparentof attributei. Parent attributes are a subset of those which influence the value of


attributeiand so have an outgoing edge to attributeiin the DAG. We refer the reader to the
VLDB publication for details on strategies to determine this parent set. Concretely, each line
has the following format: [<attridx1>, ..., <attridxn>], <meritscore>, where
the merit score is a non-negative real number that indicates the strength of the statistical
dependency (larger scores indicate stronger relationship). The graph represent indagmust
be acyclic. The content ofexample/acs13/data/acs13dag.csvis the following.

```
0
5 ,0.
1 ,6 ,0.
1 ,6 ,0.
3 ,0.
1 ,0.
10 ,0.
5 ,0.
1 ,5 ,0.
3 ,5 ,0.
1,3,9,0.
```
For instance, attributeage(line 1) has no dependencies and thus the merit score is 0. In
contrast, attributems(line 4) depends on attributesage(index/line 1) andrel(index/line
6) with a merit score of 0.27198. The last attributeincc(income class, line 11) depends on
attributesage(index/line 1),edu(index/line 3), andhpw(index/line 9).
In addition to the description of the DAG itself, the tool requires a valid graph traversal
order. Thismustbe a topological order.^6 (Otherwise,sgfgenwill terminate with an error
without producing any synthetics.) The order used is specified through theorderfile. This
file simply contains a ordered list of attributes, one per line. Theithline of the file denotes
(by index) theithattribute visited. The content of example/acs13/data/acs13order.csvis
the following.

```
1 6 3 4 5 2
```
#### 10

#### 7

#### 8

#### 9

#### 11

The sequence of attribute to be visited is:age(index 1),rel(index 6),edu(index 3),
ms(index 4),occ(index 5),wc(index 2),waob(index 10),race(index 7),sex(index 8),
hpw(index 9), andincc(index 11).
